    <h1>Bio.</h1>
    <p>Hello! Let me start off by thanking you for your visit today, I know you're probably short on time, so I'll (try to) keep it brief... My name is Alex Delgado, and I am a <em>self-taught Web Developer</em>. I learned HTML 4.0 while I was in high school because I wanted to make my AOL page cooler (the flaming text wasn't cutting it). From there, I joined my school's Web Design Club which lead me to my first job as a freelance Web Master for a small real estate firm. After two years freelancing for the firm I found a part-time position as a Web Developer working for <em>Rutgers University Student Life</em> where I spent the next three years (until graduation).</p>
    <p>Although I had graduated Rutgers with a <em>Bachelor's Degree in Economics</em>, I wanted to try to turn my love of coding into a career, so I started applying to jobs in NYC. Within a few weeks I was hired by <em>Hachette Book Group USA</em> as a front-end development contractor, and three months later, they offered me a full-time position! I spent a total of eight months working at Hachette before deciding that I wanted to get MBA in order to open up future employment opportunities. My dream school was NYU Stern, but I realized my best option would be Rutgers. So, I applied to a few open positions, and voila! I was offered a position at the <em>School of Arts and Sciences</em>. Six months later I was presented with the opportunity to move into a role with more flexibility and creativity, so I took the position with <em>Rutgers Student Life</em>. Ironically, it was the same role I had as an undergrad, but with full-time responsibilies.</p>
    <p>As an <em>Assistant Director of Marketing</em> I transformed our server ops, developed a few web apps and built up a team of interns that helped me create some cool stuff. After two and a half years at Student Life, I had finished my MBA, helped develop a solid infrastructure, and <em>managed 45+ students</em>. I had accomplished more than I set out to, but it had taken a toll on me. After two years of working full-time and going to school full-time I was exhausted, so I decided it was time for a (pretty big) change. I gave four weeks notice and planned an epic, seven-week backpacking trip through Ireland, England, Denmark, France, Italy, and Spain.</p>
    <p>There aren't enough words in any of the three languages I speak to describe how awesome my trip was. But, I am back in the U.S. and I'm on the job hunt again. In the ten years since I started freelancing I've had some pretty awesome jobs, great bosses, and I've learned so much. I would like my next job to be just as awesome. So... if you're looking for a solid Web Developer that's willing to learn, hard working, intellegent, has common sense, and know's that "fit" is important, I'm the right candidate, and I'd love to to talk to you!</p>

      <h1>Work.</h1>
      <p>Over the past ten years I have had the opportunity to work on dozens of websites, (some of which I am proud of, and others not so much...). On the bright side though, I've learned something new from every website I've built, which is knowledge that I carry with me into every new project I take on. Below are a few samples of the projects I've been fortunate to work on over the past year to provide you with a sample of what I am capable of. While I have not designed any of these websites, I've built them entirely (with the exception of Firmsconsulting, which I partnered on). I would invite you to open the source code of these websites and peruse or if you're adventurous, you can head over to my <a href="https://github.com/alexdelgado" target="_blank">GitHub account</a> and check out my public repos.</p>
